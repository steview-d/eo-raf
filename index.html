                        I’ll cut to the chase! If you’re thinking of starting to play Eve, or even starting a second account, let me help you get a head start with FREE Skill Points and FREE ISK.<br> By using the referral link on this website, when you
                        create your character, he / she will have an extra 250,000 Skill Points to spend, completely free of charge, in addition to the 400,000 or so you already begin with.<br> You WILL NOT get this if you just register a new account.
                        <br> Also, if you use my referral link, then upgrade to an Omega account (ie start paying a monthly sub), I will send you 600,000,000 Isk. Yep, 600 MILLION ISK.<br> If that’s all it takes to convince you, go right ahead now and
                        start playing. Still unsure? Keep reading pilot.

                        <h3>Is Eve any good?</h3>
                        <p>I’m biased, but yes, it’s probably the best game you’ve never played. No need to take my word for it though, Eve is now Free To Play. However, as with most F2P games, it really comes into it’s own when you add a paid subscription.</p>
                        <p>If you want to see the differences for yourself, look here.</p>
                        <p>Using my Recruit A Friend link above allows you to create a free account with an additional 250,000 skill points you wouldn’t normally get if you created an account direct through the Eve-Online website.</p>
                        <p>Once ingame, I always advise the best place to start for advice is the Rookie Help chat channel, and having a read of this, courtesy of Eve-Uni.</p>

                        <h3>What is the risk to me?</h3>
                        <p>Creating your Eve-Online account through my link above is absolutely risk free.
                            <p/>
                            <p>I don’t need, nor will I ever ask for, any personal details or payment information. Once you create an account with my link, you will instantly get your additional 250,000 skill points. You claim them in-game from the redeem
                                items menu.</p>
                            <p>When you decide to upgrade to an Omega clone (ie. paid subscription), you do this using a supported payment method (see FAQ’s for full list) and once done, contact me in-game (within 3 days) and I’ll arrange your Isk, usually
                                within 24 -48 hours.</p>
                            <p>If you don’t ever upgrade to an Omega clone, that’s fine too, nothing lost.</p>
