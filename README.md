# Eve Online - Recruit A Friend

A 1-page site aimed at people who are thinking of playing the online game 'Eve Online'.

The site encourages people to sign up for a free account via the provided link. Doing so gives the player a small head start within the game. Should they decide to purchase an OMEGA account at a later date, the site owner receives an in-game reward which is shared with the new player.

## UX
 
The sole purpose of this site is to convince would-be players to sign up for a free account using the provided referral link.

The site consists of 1 vertically scrolling page, which gradually introduces information to the user in a way so as to not overwhelm them with information. It allows the user to stop and go direct to the external sign up page at multiple points throughout their journey, without forcing them to navigate all the way to the end.
For users who don't want to sign up immediately, the site gradually introduces more information in greater detail, the further down they go.

There are a limited number of external links mid-way down that take the user to different sites which provide greater detail, so as to avoid cluttering this site. The external links open in new tabs and are intended to provide information only, and not encourage users to sign up elsewhere or through other means.

## Features

This website contains 1 singular goal, which all the below features are geared towards achieving.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - A limited time offer to double the reward the user would normally receive.
- Feature 2 - Introductory text and character portrait introducing the user to the sites offering with a high-level overview of how it all works.
- Feature 3 - A large horizontal CTA banner directing the user to start playing now via the referral link.
- Feature 4 - More information on the game itself explaining the difference between a free & paid account, in an effort to convert more free accounts into paying accounts, which provides a reward to the site owner.
- Feature 5 - A section aimed to ensure the user realises this is a risk-free offering.
- Feature 6 - FAQ section going into more detail and explaining the finer points for those users still unsure or who have more questions.

### Features Left to Implement
- Might embed a You Tube video of a trailer for the game to give more insight into the game and further encourage the user to sing up there and then.
- A comparison table showing the difference between free & paid accounts, thus negating the need to send the user to another site to see this.
